Wake-Up-Powered-by-Rdio-1.0
===========================

This is the result of the first few iterations of my app that uses the RdioÂ® API to play music at a certain time as an alarm clock.

This code is ugly and mostly hacked together since I wrote it even earlier during my learning of iOS and Objective C programming.

I might come back and fix this code so that it follows best practices, but no guarantees.
